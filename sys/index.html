        System administration is about solely configureing and maintaning servers.<br>
        The knowledge to successfully administrate in different types of environments <br>
        is essential to making the infastructure that your friendly network engineers <br>
        paved for you. </p>

            Everything is referenced and created into standards. Without standards we would <br>
            still be surrounded by companies who only created proprietary hardware, firmware, <br>
            software and only used a couple of common of ABI's (Application Binary Interfaces) <br>
            to intergrate the chaos with a couple of popular operating systems. <br>
            Now, however, the world is mostly standarized. The standards are supported by the IETF <br>
            and other public ogranization commities. Standards with different protocols, hardware <br>
            implimentations, design etc are all referenced with numbers by the creators of the idea <br>
            or standard called RFC (Request For Comment). <br>
